## Motivation

Fake news has become a challenging issue in the digital age. Mis- and dis-information can spread quickly through social media and other channels, influencing public opinion and decision-making.  
This project aims to build a classifier that can automatically distinguish between real and fake news using textual data.

---

## Project Overview

- Load and explore dataset of news articles (text & label indicating fake or real).  
- Preprocess the text (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, etc.).  
- Convert text into features (e.g. TF-IDF, Bag of Words, word embeddings).  
- Train machine learning / deep learning models (for example, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, maybe a neural network).  
- Evaluate model performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC).  
- Provide predictions for new/unseen articles.

---

## Dataset

- Source: *[mention where you got the dataset]* (e.g., Kaggle, academic datasets, scraped).  
- What it contains: number of articles, balance of fake vs real, metadata fields (title, text, author, date, etc.).  
- Any splitting into train/validation/test.

---

## Features & Preprocessing

- Text cleaning steps: lowercasing, removal of punctuation, removal of stopwords, maybe stemming or lemmatization.  
- Feature extraction: TF-IDF vectors, Bag‑of‑Words, maybe n‑grams.  
- Any dimensionality reduction or feature selection if used.  
- Handling class imbalance if present (oversampling, undersampling, weighting, etc.).

---

## Modeling

- List of models you tried (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, etc.).  
- Hyperparameter tuning (grid search, cross‑validation).  
- Any neural network or deep learning approaches if applied.

---

## Evaluation

- Metrics used: accuracy, precision, recall, F1‑score, ROC‑AUC, etc.  
- Performance on validation / test set.  
- Confusion matrix.  
- Any error analysis: types of misclassifications, sample failures.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.  
2. Install required dependencies (see [Dependencies](#dependencies)).  
3. Put dataset in the `data/` directory (or update path in code).  
4. Run the notebook (or scripts) to preprocess data, train models, evaluate.  
5. To make predictions on new text, use *[script or function]*.

## Dependencies

- Python version: e.g. `>=3.7`  
- Major libraries:  
  - `pandas`  
  - `numpy`  
  - `scikit‑learn`  
  - `nltk` or `spacy`  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (for visualizations)  
  - Others as needed (e.g. `tensorflow` / `keras` or `torch` if using deep learning)  

You can install dependencies via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Future Work

- Try advanced NLP models (e.g. BERT, transformer‑based models).  
- Incorporate metadata (author, publication date) as features.  
- Deploy the model via a web interface or API.  
- Improve robustness to adversarial fake news text.  
- Use more diverse / larger datasets, perhaps multilingual.
